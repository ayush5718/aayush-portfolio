A well-crafted portfolio isn't just about beautiful design—it's also about being **discoverable**. Below is a practical, data-driven checklist that will help your portfolio climb the Google rankings and attract the right audience.

## 1. Choose the Right Keywords

- **Primary keyword:** *developer portfolio SEO*  
- **Secondary keywords:** *personal website SEO*, *showcase projects on Google*, *improve portfolio ranking*  

Use these naturally in headings, meta tags, and the first 150 characters of your content.

## 2. Optimize Page Titles and Meta Descriptions

Every page on your portfolio should have a unique, keyword-rich title and a compelling meta description. Your blog pages already pull these values from the front-matter automatically.

Keep titles under 60 characters and descriptions under 155 characters for best display in search results.

## 3. Structured Data (JSON-LD)

Your blog pages already inject a `BlogPosting` schema which helps Google understand your content better. This can lead to rich snippets in search results, making your links stand out.

Key fields to populate:
- **headline** - Your post title
- **datePublished** - When the article was published
- **description** - A brief summary
- **author** - Your name and details

## 4. Use Proper Heading Hierarchy

Structure matters for both users and search engines:

- **H1** - Page title (only one per page)
- **H2** - Main section headings
- **H3** - Sub-sections within H2

This hierarchy signals content structure to crawlers and improves accessibility.

## 5. Write High-Quality, Long-Form Content

Aim for **1,200-1,500 words** minimum for blog posts. Include:

- Real-world examples and case studies
- Bullet points and tables for readability
- Internal links to your projects and other blog posts
- External links to authoritative sources

## 6. Optimize Images and Media

Images can slow down your site and hurt SEO if not optimized:

- Use **WebP** or **AVIF** formats for smaller file sizes
- Add descriptive `alt` attributes for accessibility and SEO
- Lazy load images below the fold
- Use a CDN like ImageKit for fast delivery

## 7. Mobile-First and Core Web Vitals

Google uses Core Web Vitals as ranking factors:

| Metric | Target | What It Measures |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| LCP | Under 2.5s | Largest Contentful Paint |
| FID | Under 100ms | First Input Delay |
| CLS | Under 0.1 | Cumulative Layout Shift |

Your Next.js + Tailwind setup is already lightweight and responsive. Test your site with Google PageSpeed Insights regularly.

## 8. Sitemap and Robots.txt

Your portfolio now has:
- A dynamic `sitemap.xml` that auto-updates with every new blog post
- A `robots.txt` that guides search engines on how to crawl your site

Submit your sitemap to Google Search Console after deploying.

## 9. Build Backlinks

Quality backlinks signal authority to search engines:

- Share posts on **Twitter**, **LinkedIn**, and **Dev.to**
- Contribute to open-source projects and link back to your portfolio
- Write guest posts on tech blogs
- Engage in developer communities like Reddit and Discord

## 10. Track and Iterate

Use these free tools to monitor your SEO progress:

- **Google Search Console** - See which queries bring traffic
- **Google Analytics** - Understand user behavior
- **PageSpeed Insights** - Monitor performance metrics

## Quick Checklist

Here's a summary you can reference for every new blog post:

1. Target a specific keyword in the title
2. Write a compelling meta description
3. Use H1, H2, H3 tags properly
4. Include internal and external links
5. Optimize all images with alt text
6. Ensure fast load times on mobile
7. Share on social media after publishing

Implement these steps consistently and you'll see your portfolio's organic traffic grow over time. SEO is a long-term game, but the results are worth it.

Good luck ranking!
